                    <p class="clearfix">The candidate has no adverse information on social media. However, his Google search revealed that he
                        was involved in a Law Suit against Avery Limited for unfair termination.
                        The details of the case are as summarized below as quoted in the case: The reason given for the
                        dismissal was thus, “It has been brought to management attention that while discharging your duties as
                        an Environment Health & Safety Manager, you acted in a manner that has compromised company
                        interest contrary to clause (7) of your employment contract, details of which you are aware”. Clause 7 of
                        the contract provided thus, “During your service with the Company you will be expected to follow and
                        adhere to the rules and regulations of the Company as amended from time to time. You will also be
                        expected to be loyal to the Company and keep to yourself any Company secrets that come to your
                        knowledge.
                        You will be expected to act responsibly while in a very competitive market.” Particulars of the alleged
                        breach were not set out in the letter of summary dismissal. In conclusion, judgment was hereby entered
                        for the claimant against the respondent for: a) The declaration that the termination of the claimant’s
                        employment by the respondent’s letter dated 19.06.2013 was unfair, illegal, unjustified and unlawful as
                        was contrary to the law. b) The respondent to pay the claimant a sum of Kshs.1, 251, 000.00 by
                        01.07.2017 failing interest to be Payable thereon at court rates from the date of the suit till full payment.
                        c) The respondent to pay the claimant’s costs of the suit. Signed, dated and delivered in court at Nairobi
                        this Wednesday, 5th April, 2017 by the presiding Judge Ramsey Notes.
